# Fake_News_Detection_With_Explainable_AI_Using_Lime

In today's digital age, the rapid expansion of online platforms has revolutionized how information is shared. While this has enhanced accessibility, it has also led to the widespread dissemination of misinformation, particularly fake news. The consequences of such misinformation can be significant, shaping public opinion, fueling social unrest, and even influencing critical decision-making processes.

To tackle the challenge of fake news detection, advanced techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning are essential. This research focuses on a comparative analysis of two widely used models for fake news detection: Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). Additionally, it integrates Explainable AI principles using LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) to enhance transparency and interpretability in the modelsâ€™ predictions.

Bi-LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network, excels at capturing sequential relationships in textual data, making it effective for language-based tasks. Meanwhile, BERT, a transformer-based model, has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across various NLP applications by utilizing attention mechanisms to understand context deeply. This study systematically compares the two models in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability for detecting fake news.

Understanding fake news detection is crucial for advancing technology, improving media literacy, and strengthening information-sharing systems. By incorporating LIME, this research aims to provide interpretable explanations for model predictions, helping users trust and comprehend how these AI models arrive at their decisions.

The key objectives of this study include:

Evaluating the accuracy of Bi-LSTM and BERT in distinguishing real and fake news.
Analyzing their efficiency in processing large datasets.
Implementing LIME to enhance interpretability.
Exploring potential correlations between the most frequent words identified by TF-IDF vectorization and LIME explanations.
The findings of this research could contribute valuable insights to the ongoing fight against misinformation, supporting researchers, policymakers, and technologists in developing more reliable and transparent fake news detection frameworks.
